Based on http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/experimenting-with-node-js/ with the addition of JavaScript broadcasting and eval.
This system is completely open and unrestricted.  Use at your own risk.  Please consider not disabling my server or doing things that idiots, eight-year-olds or criminals would find amusing.  Also, instead of alerts, use something like $('#msg').append('my text') (alerts causing weird infinite dialog problem in Chrome so any JS with alert in it is not sent).
JavaScript (including jQuery) you enter here is broadcast and eval'd by all clients.  To save data use save.php (source of save.php: file_put_contents($_GET['filename'], $_POST['data'])) or append.php (same but with FILE_APPEND). Directory index is readable.
